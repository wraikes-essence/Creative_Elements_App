Welcome to the open sourced Creative Elements app.  Feel free to clone, code and contribute!

This application has high aspirations.  On the most basic level, this data product will allow users to input different creative related
criteria to estimate the lift on brand KPIs.

As of now, we intend to use Flask for this application, and house it on a Heroku server.  Another potential add-on is to use Tensorflow
to estimate brand KPIs based on the creative itself (a form of video classification).
